# number-comparing-tool
This python program can compare numbers. This was my first python program idea but I forgot about it because I coded it wrong too many times, but today, I decided that I have to code this.
This can compare decimal numbers too.
For example if you compare 56 and 56.1, It will print "The second number is bigger."(56.1) And I just thought of a new idea so stay tuned for new releases.
